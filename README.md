## Lab Descriptions

### Lab 1: Cabling
This lab focuses on the basics of cabling, including the types of cables used in networking and how to connect different devices using appropriate cables.

### Lab 2: Introduction to Cisco Packet Tracer
An introductory lab that covers the basics of using Cisco Packet Tracer, a network simulation tool used to visualize and practice network configurations.

### Lab 3: DNS, DHCP, and Web Server Setup and Configuration
This lab involves setting up and configuring DNS, DHCP, and web servers. It covers the basics of assigning IP addresses dynamically and resolving domain names.

### Lab 4: Basic Subnetting Using Router
In this lab, you'll learn about subnetting and how to configure a router to manage subnets within a network.

### Lab 5: Static Routing
This lab covers the concept of static routing and how to configure routers with static routes to direct traffic in a network.

### Lab 6: Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
Learn about the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and how to configure routers to use RIP for dynamic routing.

### Lab 7: Access Control List (ACL)
This lab focuses on creating and applying Access Control Lists (ACLs) to control network traffic and enforce security policies.

### Lab 8: VLAN Configuration
In this lab, you'll learn about Virtual LANs (VLANs) and how to configure switches to create and manage VLANs.
